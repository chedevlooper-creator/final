# Test

Run the Vitest test suite.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage

## Notes

- Tests use Vitest with Testing Library
- Test files are in `src/__tests__/` or co-located
- API routes are excluded from coverage (tested separately)
- Fix any failing tests before committing
